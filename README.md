Starbucks was born as a whole coffee beans seller in Pike’s place market in Seattle, Washington in 1971 . It is now the biggest coffee chain in the world expanding globally with over 40,000 stores globally as of 2025. 

As part of their Loyalty program, Starbucks rewards , different offer types have been sent to customers over a month of time. The use case is to study customer behaviour towards each offer type and then to segment those customers based on their behaviours for Starbucks to come up with data driven strategies to enhance customer experience.
